<p>4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, being sure to use a rubber spatula to get it all out of the bowl. Hold the pan just a little bit above the counter and then drop it on the counter to eliminate any air bubbles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Bake until the cake is beautifully golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Transfer the cake, still in its pan, to a wire rack and let it cool completely. Once cool, use a dinner knife to loosen the edges of the cake from the pan and invert it onto your work surface (you might need to give the pan a little whack). Peel off and discard the parchment. Invert the cake one more time onto a serving platter so the flat side is down and the domed side is up.</p>

<li>(0.004651162790697674 cups extra-virgin olive oil 1900.6 Cal)</li>
<li>(0.005 cups granulated sugar 774.0 Cal)</li>
<li>(1.0 cups vanilla extract 0 Cal)</li>

<h2>Instrucciones</h2>
<p></p>
<p>1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Use your hands to butter the bottom and sides of an 8 in cake pan, then line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper. </p>
<p></p>
<p>2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, ground almonds, baking powder, and salt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until the whites and yolks are fully combined. Add the olive oil and granulated sugar and whisk until the sugar is dissolved (test by rubbing some of the mixture between two fingers). Whisk in the vanilla, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Whisk in the flour mixture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, being sure to use a rubber spatula to get it all out of the bowl. Hold the pan just a little bit above the counter and then drop it on the counter to eliminate any air bubbles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Bake until the cake is beautifully golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Transfer the cake, still in its pan, to a wire rack and let it cool completely. Once cool, use a dinner knife to loosen the edges of the cake from the pan and invert it onto your work surface (you might need to give the pan a little whack). Peel off and discard the parchment. Invert the cake one more time onto a serving platter so the flat side is down and the domed side is up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Just before serving, dust the cake with powdered sugar.</p>

<p>6. Transfer the cake, still in its pan, to a wire rack and let it cool completely. Once cool, use a dinner knife to loosen the edges of the cake from the pan and invert it onto your work surface (you might need to give the pan a little whack). Peel off and discard the parchment. Invert the cake one more time onto a serving platter so the flat side is down and the domed side is up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Just before serving, dust the cake with powdered sugar.</p>

<p>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</p>

<h2>Ingredientes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(4 cups New York Strip Steaks (2 steaks), or Ribeye or Top Sirloin Steaks (1 lb each steak, 1.25 inches thick) 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(1.0 cups vegetable oil, or any high heat cooking oil like canola or extra light olive oil 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(3.0 cups sea salt 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(2 cups black pepper, freshly ground 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(4 cups unsalted butter 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(4 cups garlic, peeled and quartered 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(2 cups fresh rosemary 131/50 Cal)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instrucciones</h2>
<p>1. Thoroughly pat steak dry with paper towels. Just before cooking, generously season with 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat. </p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Once the oil is very hot, add steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks on the first side for 4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then flip and cook another 3-4 minutes. Using tongs, turn the steak on its sides to render the white fat and sear the edges (1-minute per edge).</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Reduce heat to medium and immediately add 2 Tbsp butter, quartered garlic cloves and rosemary to the pan. Spoon the butter sauce over the steak, tilting the pan to get butter on your spoon. Continue spooning the sauce over the steak for a minute or until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from your desired doneness (the temperature will continue to rise another 5-19 degrees while steaks rest).</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2" strips to serve. Spoon extra butter sauce over sliced steak to serve.</p>
<h2>Extra:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic butter that makes it taste like a steakhouse quality meal. You'll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak that's seared on the outside, and perfectly tender inside.</p>

<p>1. Thoroughly pat steak dry with paper towels. Just before cooking, generously season with 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat. </p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Once the oil is very hot, add steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks on the first side for 4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then flip and cook another 3-4 minutes. Using tongs, turn the steak on its sides to render the white fat and sear the edges (1-minute per edge).</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Reduce heat to medium and immediately add 2 Tbsp butter, quartered garlic cloves and rosemary to the pan. Spoon the butter sauce over the steak, tilting the pan to get butter on your spoon. Continue spooning the sauce over the steak for a minute or until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from your desired doneness (the temperature will continue to rise another 5-19 degrees while steaks rest).</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2" strips to serve. Spoon extra butter sauce over sliced steak to serve.</p>

<p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic butter that makes it taste like a steakhouse quality meal. You'll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak that's seared on the outside, and perfectly tender inside.</p>

<h2>Ingredientes</h2>
<ul>
<li>(4 cups New York Strip Steaks (2 steaks), or Ribeye or Top Sirloin Steaks (1 lb each steak, 1.25 inches thick) 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(1.0 cups vegetable oil, or any high heat cooking oil like canola or extra light olive oil 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(3.0 cups sea salt 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(2 cups black pepper, freshly ground 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(4 cups unsalted butter 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(4 cups garlic, peeled and quartered 0 Cal)</li>
<li>(2 cups fresh rosemary 131/50 Cal)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instrucciones</h2>
<p>1. Thoroughly pat steak dry with paper towels. Just before cooking, generously season with 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat. </p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Once the oil is very hot, add steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks on the first side for 4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then flip and cook another 3-4 minutes. Using tongs, turn the steak on its sides to render the white fat and sear the edges (1-minute per edge).</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Reduce heat to medium and immediately add 2 Tbsp butter, quartered garlic cloves and rosemary to the pan. Spoon the butter sauce over the steak, tilting the pan to get butter on your spoon. Continue spooning the sauce over the steak for a minute or until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from your desired doneness (the temperature will continue to rise another 5-19 degrees while steaks rest).</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2" strips to serve. Spoon extra butter sauce over sliced steak to serve.</p>
<h2>Extra:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic butter that makes it taste like a steakhouse quality meal. You'll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak that's seared on the outside, and perfectly tender inside.</p>
